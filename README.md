Project Setup
Clone down the project (do not fork the repository).

While in the root directory of the project, run npm install to install all of the project dependencies.

Run npm start to run the app.

Git Flow
For using Git and GitHub on this project, please read and follow this guide that was provided by Edd Burke.

Make sure to not work directly on main. Always create a feature branch with an appropriate name.

Post in Slack ahead of time what feature you will be working on in the app, so that people don't accidentally work on the same feature. Communication is key!

Create branches using meaningful names. Along with this, don't make merge requests for branches that don't do much

Document the changes you make on your branch into their pull request description so that other developers can know what changes have been made without having to read through the file changes

Whenever a new branch is merged with main, run git pull origin main to stay up to date with main.

When you pull from main and a new dependency has been added to the project, be sure to run npm install to update your dependencies and install the new dependencies.

Please post every pull requests you make into the Slack channel when it is ready for review. This step is essential to keep us all on the same page. Every pull request needs at least one review before it can be merged (this should prevent merge conflicts from happening).

DO NOT SKIMP OUT ON REVIEWING PULL REQUESTS


TITLE
African Marketplace

Pitchü¶æ
Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. 

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listing for items they have for sale. 

MVPüéØ

1. A small business `owner` can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.

2. They can also make listing for `items` they want to sell, which will show up to all `users`.

3. They add a new `item` by selecting their market `location` and typing in their item's `name`, `description`, and `price`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Stretch**

1. A business `owner` can upload their `picture` to their profile.
